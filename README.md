# Affiliate Links Bot for Telegram

Are you a Telegram group admin and users post links to articles in Amazon, Gearbest, etc. using their own affiliate? Some of them want to get profit of it, even posting links to not really valuable articles.

Affiliate Links Bot is a open source bot written in NodeJS that aims at controlling the affiliate links posted in your group. You can set your own affiliate as a way of maintaining the group, a blog or forum related to it, etc or just remove user provided affiliates so nobody gets profit. Another option, which I love, is to keep the defaults as a donation to the developer ;) 

## Documentation

This is still a task to be done, but by using the command 'settings_menu' you can customize the behaviour using friendly menus.

## Disclaimer

There is still a lot of work to be done. Any help is welcome, either for testing or developing. I will try to enhance the features and answer request on my free time, which is not too much.
